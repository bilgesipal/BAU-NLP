## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will:
1. Apply NLP techniques to solve real-world business problems.
2. Implement classical and deep learning-based NLP models for industry use cases.
3. Build practical NLP solutions with API-based and low-code approaches.
4. Evaluate NLP models.

## Assessment & Evaluation
### Assignments (30%): 
- Programming exercises on NLP fundamentals and deep learning models.
### First Assignment 
- The report and the GitHub link for your Code must be sent to my email by the end of 27.10.2025
- The Presentations will be on  31.10.2025
### Second Assignment 
- The report and the GitHub link for your Code must be sent to my mail by the end of TBA
- The Presentations will be on  TBA
## Midterm Project (30%):  Exam (TBA Lecture Room)
## Final Project (40%): End-to-end NLP system involving deep learning. 
- The Proposals for the Final Project (you must discuss with me and get my approval )  TBA
- The Final Project Reports and the GitHub link must be sent to my email address by the end of TBA
- The Final Project Presentations will be on TBA, place TBA 
- You are expected to answer the questions on the technologies that you are using (be cautious about using a technology that you do not know)
- For the Final Presentation, you are expected to answer questions covering all the Lecture Topics and related topics to your project
### Deliverables for Assignments and Final Projects
- Project proposals (a report on what you are planning to build, max 1-page design document)
- Working prototype (no points, if your code is not running)
- Presentation (with Demo) and final report 
- The reports must be written like a technical report and should not be more than 2 pages.

#### Only for Assignments (not the Final), teamwork is encouraged

- The presentations must be done in the class (no pre-recorded videos)
- You are expected to fetch your code from GitHub and show that your code works (Demo part of your presentation) 

**Important**: someone else  might run your demo or you might be asked to run your demo on a random computer

- For the assignments, you are expected to answer questions from your audience as well. The answers will be evaluated as a part of the  Presentation Skill Evaluation.
## Evaluation of Assignments and Final Project - 100 Points:
- Working Prototype  (30 points: 10 points for GitHub usage, 10 points for Clean Code (check pep8 and other tools such as ruff), 10 points if it runs as explained in the report)
- Presentation (60 points - 10 questions each 5 points, 10 points for the Presentation Skills)
- For the Final Presentation, you are expected to answer 5 questions covering all the Lecture Topics
- Project Report (10 points: 5 points for Drawio/Visio  usage and 5 points on whether it fits with the presented Demo)
## Miscellaneous on your Code:
- Get a GitHub Account
- Create a ReadMe in your Repo and Explain how to run your code explicitly 
- DO NOT  change your code on GitHub after sharing your link with me
